Q: If Musicoin isn't based on traditional currency, how do listeners obtain coins?
A: All coins will come from mining. However, since we do not expect casual users to setup mining on their own, Musicoin.org will subsidize listening for early adopters. Therefore, early adopters will listen for free, but artists will be paid in full from day 1. The coins used by Musicoin will be mined by our servers.

Eventually, coins will be available for purchase on an exchange, or other 3rd party services may offer a alternative model. However, in all cases, regardless of the model used to give access to listeners, each play will result in a payment.

Q: Who sets the price per play--the musician or the listener?
A: Our goal is to allow musicians themselves to control everything. They can follow the template to set a standard price (which is one coin per play), or they can set a higher or lower prices based on their personal will. Additionally, musicians can customize how how each payment is distributed.

Q: What incentive is there for fans to pay for music?
A: We believe that users, in general, would be happy to support their favorite musicians and that piracy is driven by two factors:

(1) convenience

(2) a disconnect between the listener and the artist

By building a simple, low-cost system that provides a direct connection between listeners and artists, we believe there will be little incentive to obtain music illegally.

Q: How can I obtain an invite?
A: We want to make sure every musician and listener has a good experience using musicoin, so weâ€™re slowly increasing the number of users. If you are a musician or just interested in beta-testing, send an email to musicoin@musicoin.org.

What are shares? Can I use percentages instead?
Shares should be expressed in whole numbers. If your shares add up to 100, they are the same as percentages. However, sometimes it's easier to just express things in shares. For instance, if there are three band members, and all of them should get an equal amount, instead of writing 33.333% for each, just give each member 1 share.

If you would rather express as percentages, you can. In fact, in the case above you can give everyone 33 shares. It's ok that is only adds up to 99, since everyone will get 33 out if 99 shares (exactly 1/3rd). Finally, the license Preview page will show the computed percentage.

Q: What should I enter in the 'recipient' field when creating a license?
A: A recipient needs to be an address on the musicoin network. You can find your address on the 'my profile' page by clicking the 'show options' link in the 'my wallet' section. For convenience, you can enter an email address of a registered user. If that user has created a profile, you will see their address in the preview page along with the email address you entered. You can also enter the address of another license.

For example, if you have an agreement with another artist to pay them 10% of each play for sampling from their song, you can enter their song's license address in the recipient field. Then, each time your song is played, it will send 10% to their license, and then their license will distribute the payment as it normally would for a play.

What is a 'wallet-only' account?
You can create a wallet-only account so that you have a separate address to distribute funds to.

For instance, if you have multiple band members, you would create one account for the band (e.g. 'peter-paul-and-mary@gmail.com') and then each member would create a separate wallet only account with a personal e-mail address (peter@gmail.com, paul@gmail.com, mary@gmail.com). Music can be released from the band's profile, and payments can be distributed to the individual accounts.

Having a personal wallet-only account will also allow you to easily collaborate with other artists.
