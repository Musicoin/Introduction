# Musicoin Introduction

Musicoin is the first blockchain designed specifically for music licensing and consumption. However, unlike most blockchains, Musicoin has not pre-allocated any funds to the founding members.  Instead, 100% of the coins will be mined by the community, starting from today. The blockchain was built upon existing technologies from Bitcoin (1G), Ethereum (2G) and other security measures customized for music licensing, development and consumptions. So itâ€™s a 3G blockchain technology.
