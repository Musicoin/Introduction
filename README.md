# Musicoin Introduction

Musicoin blockchain is the first blockchain designed specifically for music licensing and consumption. However, unlike most blockchains, Musicoin has not pre-allocated any funds to the founding members.  Instead, 100% of the coins will be [mined](https://github.com/Musicoin/go-musicoin/wiki/Start-a-miner) by the community, starting from today. The blockchain was built upon existing technologies from Bitcoin (1G), Ethereum (2G) and other security measures customized for music licensing, development and consumptions. So it’s a 3G blockchain technology.  

# Features of Musicoin

Musicoin’s blockchain is born to be immune. It generates 500 coins per block generated every 15 seconds to meet the micropayment needs for music consumption. With smart contract technology, the blockchain can run a special machine code called a [Pay-Per-Play](https://github.com/Musicoin/Introduction/wiki/Pay-Per-Play(PPP)) Pay-Per-Play) license (PPP). Every time a track released by a musician is played, whenever and wherever, the license code will be triggered and confirmed by tons of other users. This code snippet will soon become the most executed transactions (can we drop the s from transaction?) because the enjoyment of music will back the whole Musicoin economy, aka Musiconomy.

# Musicoin Loves Musicians

Musicoin's value is backed by music consumption, thus musicians are definitely the top driven force of using the blockchain and its currency. “Musicoin will bring a level of transparency and fairness to the music industry”,said  - Alan Cross  A Journal Of Musical Things , “ that has never been seen before! It has the potential to completely change the way we consume music.” Many musicians welcome this new technologies with preparing their content to release to Musicoin blokcchain.   

#Musicoin Ecosystem

Musicoin is fully open-sourced project with clear [road map]. Based on blockchain, musicians will be able to use the simplest tools to release their musical works, while developers can create fantastic applications and gadgets to make music flow through every devices and eventually remunerate musicians. Other artists can also find great satisfaction around the core model of this system, many value-added ideas can be realized upon the system. The only limitation will be imagination.
